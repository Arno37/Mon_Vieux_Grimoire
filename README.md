## Description

Mon Vieux Grimoire is a book rating and review website developed for a small chain of bookstores named "Le Vieux Grimoire" in Lille. The site allows members to add new books and give ratings visible to the public.

## Project Overview

As a freelance back-end developer based in the Lille region, I have been tasked with developing the back-end for this project. The front-end of the site will be developed in React. The functional specifications for the first version have been defined, and the site mockup has been designed.

- Developing the back-end infrastructure
- Setting up the API to interact with the front-end
- Ensuring secure and efficient data management

## Features

- User authentication and management
- Book catalog with the ability to add and edit entries
- Rating and review system for books
- API endpoints to support front-end functional

## Prerequisites
